#### Project: Tree water balance in a semiarid pine forest and rates of survival under global climate change

Longer droughts and temperature rise impose severe risks of widespread forest mortality.
Drought-adapted trees in semiarid and arid ecosystems cope with water stress by regulating their transpiration rate, thus saving internal water content and avoiding 
runaway decline in water potential.

Our goal is to characterize how trees manage their water budget in order to increase survival probability under prolonged drought periods.
<!-- Furthermore, we wish to understand the relative role of soil water stress and vapor pressure deficit on the tree strategies for maintaining its internal water storage. -->

Our group will approach these objectives by *modeling* the soil-tree-atmosphere water transport to assess tree survival probability for current and future climate scenarios.
A collaboration with an experimental group will provide us data from a research station in the Yatir forest, in the Negev desert (see map above).

Studying the fate of the Yatir forest gives us a window into the future, for it is expected that many ecosystems around the world will face increasing drought stress as a result of climate change.
