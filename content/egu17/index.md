From April 23 to 28 I'll be in Vienna for the 2017 EGU meeting.

I'm presenting a poster on Monday 24, at Hall X1, board number X1.369, from 17:30 to 19:00.
The poster is entitled

>>**"Water and salt dynamics and the hydraulic conductivity feedback: irreversible soil degradation and reclamation opportunities"**.

You are invited to talk to me, and to find more details, download a "light pdf version" of my poster. [<i class="entypo entypo-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>](/images/yairmau_egu2017.pdf)
