Visualizations can take a message very, very far.
I put a lot of thinking into how to best express an idea.
I believe that great graphs greatly improve a scientific paper, and a thoughful graph/animation surely brings home the main point of a talk.
Here are a few thoughts on visualizations.

## Colors
Don't use the <span style="color:red">r</span><span style="color:orange">a</span><span style="color:olive">i</span><span style="color:green">n</span><span style="color:teal">b</span><span style="color:blue">o</span><span style="color:fuchsia">w</span> color map.  
Ever.

So how should you choose the colors for a graph?

* Visit [colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/). It gives sequential, diverging and qualitative colormaps that can be chosen to be "colorblind safe", "print safe", or "photocopy safe". Usually, it is the first and only tool I use. It's just great!
* Visit [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/). It gives you much more freedom to play with the colors than colorbrewer. Use it wisely!
