Last August I came back to Israel, after 3 years in North Carolina, USA. It was a very nice period of my life, but it is great to be back!
 
I already have an office in the Department of Soil and Water Sciences, and I'm starting to get acquainted with the people and the facilites. You can find me in office 19 (ground floor) in Lubell building. Come have some coffee with me! ([Precise location here](http://w3w.co/lifts.hobbit.goat)).
 
I'm excited to be here, and to start my research. Right now I'm recruiting excellent students for my research group, if you are interested in what we do, please make contact.
 
I will (hopefully) make constant updates here, telling about my research, about something interesting that I'd like to share with you, events that I participated, etc.
 
Thank you for visiting my website,
Cheers,
Yair
