From April 8 to 13 I'll be in Vienna for the 2018 EGU meeting.

I'm presenting a poster on Thursday 12, at Hall X3, board number X3.160, from 17:30 to 19:00.
The poster is entitled

>>**"Drought resilience of dryland ecosystems under spatial periodic forcing"**.

You are invited to talk to me, and to find more details, download the png of my poster. [<i class="entypo entypo-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>](/images/yairmau_egu2018.png)
